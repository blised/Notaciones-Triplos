A landing page template.

* [Getting started](#getting-started)

## Getting started
* First, ensure that you have docker, so you are able to run this docker enviorement.
* Next, use your command line to enter your project directory (Idea3/backend).
* This template comes with a ready-to-use package file (docker file, requirements.txt), you only have to "docker-compose build" to install all the packcage and requirments for the project

You're ready to go! Run any task by typing on your terminal "docker-compose up", keep in mind that is using port 8000, but you can change it.

NOTE:
if you make any changes on the program, you'll have to "build" the docker container againg, even if you already installed the requirements (they wont install twice). Then "up" for the container.
